        <h1>What is the Check Yo’ Self project?</h1>
        <p>
            The purpose of the Check Yo’ Self project was to educate young people on media literacy and political awareness and for them to realize how powerful the media is in shaping a society.  In an age of misinformation, the 10th graders at High Tech High Mesa set out to find the truth behind how the media portrays politics and controversial chemicals in their Humanities and Chemistry classes.  They created posters about the upcoming 2020 election ballot measures and different controversial chemicals to help better inform themselves, their community, and voters in California.

            <p>
                What's the mayor's name? Who are our senators, state or congressional? How do federal elections work? Does any of this matter and is Dick Cheney still pulling the strings? All things we should know and learn about in school. But to start with we focus on what affects us here and now. Propositions in the California legislature to be voted on soon. Each student was assigned a partner and a proposition based on their preferences. We dived deep into the propositions, the topic of the propositions, and the history surrounding that topic. Each partner took a side and as we learned we created our opinions and arguments. The result was a poster each partnership made in an effort to inform likely voters and share the keen awareness we had all gained. Wake up, vote, and take a look at the Ballot Measure Poster project...

            <h2>Controversial Chemicals</h2>
            <h3 class="subtitle">10th grade chemistry</h3>
            <p>
                Did you know that the compounds formed in toothbrushes when used for long periods of time with certain toothpastes can cause cancer? Me neither because it's not true, but you really didn't know did you?  Radium used to be in our watches so they could be seen at night. Which by itself wasn't deadly but would have been nice to know. What was, in fact, deadly was the direct exposure that the “Radium Girls” suffered while producing these watches. And boy did their jaws drop when they found out. Literally, because of radiation poisoning their jaws fell off. In an effort to keep our jaws, we set out to investigate the chemicals around us. We studied chemical structures and the periodic table all the while making connections to the past and understanding how(if at all) things around us affected our anatomy. Taking inspiration from Rob Billot, we then created these posters and would like to share them with you for everyone's benefit. In the end we learned chemistry and kept our jaws so please take a look at the Controversial Chemical Poster project...
